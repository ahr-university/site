<p>At the end of each semester students get to see the results of their hard work over the past semester, the majority of our students get above average grades, but there is always a minority thats under achieving</p>
<p>Nonetheless our students are hard working students and their results reflect that, across all our facilities the average GPA is 2.986 for each semester.</p>

<p>We try to work with those minority to bring up their grades and strengthen our education system, in order to keep the students grades acceptable to only them we have implemented that under the students portal.</p>
