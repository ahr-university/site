<p>As an international University its part of our job to give students a place to stay and live in until they finish their studies, our mahallas(dorms) offer the students a place to go back to after a long day of classes and exhaustion, In each Mahallah you'll find small shops ,cafeterias laundry services and other necessary life needs.</p>
<p>We made sure the experience of living in AHR is same across all dorms, by consistently improving all places and giving the students an <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/services/complains" title=""> online platform </a> to report any issues regarding in any of the Mahallah's facilities, each dorm is named after an old civilization to emphasize our strong connection with our past history. </p>
