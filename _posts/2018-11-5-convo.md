<p> AHR university welcome for new students, their friends and families.</p>
<p>New Student Convocation is one of only two occasions where the University president, the Board of Regents, the deans of the 16 schools and colleges and the faculty gather in a formal academic setting focused on students. The other, of course, is the graduation ceremony, Commencement. These two events are the seminal “bookend” events of a college career.</p>
<p> At New Student Convocation you will:</p>
- Find out about your classmates from the Dean of Undergraduate Academic Affairs.
- Get tips from your student body president on how to make the most of your college experience.

- Learn about some of the exciting educational opportunities that await you.
<p>Upon arriving, students and guests (parents and friends) will be directed by faculty marshals to their respective seating sections</p>
