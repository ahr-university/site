<p> it takes time to learn something new regardless of how hard or easy it is,  at first i was like "man this is really not my thing" the things i work with or do on daily basis (kernel and android ROM's development" are as far earth and its moon, i was hardly able to decipher  the whole jekyll site structure after few tries i had a basic site running on my local host, next step was the styling and adding all the stuff i honestly had no idea where to begin, i fiddled there and there and it just made things worse.</p>
<p>I called   it a day after that and focused on other tasks, next time i was on this again i started reading about jekyll and how it works and why it exists and every other time i would Google things which i cannot comprehend.</p>
<p> This time i came kinda prepared with an idea to use a theme and work my way up there so few hours searching and finally found the perfect theme.</p>

<p> Next thing was to implement the theme, even my very high git experience didn't help much with that, i had to think in a different way and look at it from a different perspective, and again after few hours of playing on my local host i got the basic theme skeleton running on local host.</p>
<p>Next i started editing things from the general config.yaml file to the header and footer and finally add few more pages for other site sections.</p>  
<p>from there i had a little experience with this web thing, but the work needed next level skills, so i had to evolve from just editing random HTML to inspecting and modifying CSS and javascript, and with time it got even easier. </p>
<p> At this point i had a fairly good looking site but there were a lot  of unnecessary items, menus, spacings, headers and the list goes on, i started the purge mission and worked on it almost everyday, while at the same time still adding modifications and experimenting with different styles.</p>
<p> When i felt like the site is finally clean enough, it was time to add more content and still hammer few bugs and some random minor inconstancies, created few more posts and more layouts and the ideas never stopped flowing, adding new things everyday and also shifting the focus more towered the content instead of the side menu's or other design elements.</p>
<p> Finally my group mates showed and worked on few pages which was great, added few articles as well, the site is looking good now. </p>
<p> However until now i still consider it as a work on progress, it doesn't look broken but am definitely going to fix it. </p>
